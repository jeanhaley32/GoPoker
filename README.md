# GoPoker - Kinda Abandoned. If I ever decided to pick this up again, i'll probably rewrite the whole thing.

This is a toy script for me to practice GoLang, it's not close to complete or usable, and will probably break more as I
add/remove things. 

I'm commiting incomplete changes so that I can keep this workspace synchronized between multiple work stations, so I do not
expect for this script to compile successfully at all times. Hopefully this will change as I get closer to completing it.
